# Malaria Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting malaria-infected cells through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset comprises 27,558 images categorized into "Infected" and "Uninfected" cells, sourced from the official NIH website: [Malaria Datasets](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/).

## Visualizing the Data

The dataset is organized into "Infected" and "Uninfected" folders, with a total of 27,558 images.

## Image Manipulation

To enhance model generalization, image data is augmented using Keras' ImageDataGenerator. This introduces variations like rotation, shifting, and zooming to the dataset.

## Preparing the Data for the Model

Data is organized into subdirectories as required by Keras. The ImageDataGenerator is then employed to generate batches of manipulated images during model training.

## Creating the Model

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed using Keras, consisting of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

## Early Stopping

To prevent overfitting, early stopping is implemented during model training.

## Training the Model

The model is trained using the prepared dataset with specified data augmentation techniques.

## Evaluating the Model

The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset. Graphs illustrating loss and accuracy during training are provided.

## Predicting on an Image

A demonstration of predicting malaria infection on a single image using the trained model.

## Results

Graphs depicting the training and evaluation results are included, showcasing the model's effectiveness in malaria detection.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks for malaria detection based on the provided dataset.
